# QuizApp

## App Description
I started this quiz app as a tutorial, but I wanted to add some configurations.

### Added Features
- Selection category
- Timing for questions
- Quiz exit feature

## App Features 
- I created an object called Constants to create a single reference point for constant values. I keep total questions and their answer, user name in this object.
- For questions and to get questions according to their category, I have Question, Category Data Class.
- So, the user can start the quiz with her/his name, select category and solve the questions in the given time.

## Features to be developed
- User authentication
- Result page can upgrade
